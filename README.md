# Network-structure-of-international-trade

DATA

World network of manufactured metal products trade between countries in 1994

 Nodes: 80 countries without most of Africa and ex-Soviet Republics;

 Edges: relations of import and export;

 Weights: volume of trade expressed in millions of dollars;

 Attributes: world system classification, continent, GDP per capita.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS

1. Does the asymmetrical world-system structure emerge in the manufactured metal products trade networks?

Calculating the distribution of weighted in and out degrees (imports and exports of countries).

2. Which clusters of countries based on trade patterns can be isolated?

Cluster analysis of countries on basis of their weighted in and out degrees (country profile).

3. Do these clusters correspond to existing world system classification?

Cross tabulation comparison between empirical and theoretical categories.

CONCLUSIONS

1. Does the asymmetrical world-system structure emerge in the manufactured metal products trade networks?
Most of the countries have smaller amounts of imports and exports, while minority has extremely large ones. However, biggest exporters are also the biggest importers. 

2. Which clusters of countries based on trade patterns can be isolated?
Raw results: US and Germany as by far biggest importers and exporters; core countries and peripheries and semi-peripheries combined
Results with log transformation: core, upper semi-periphery, lower semi-periphery and periphery

3. Do these clusters correspond to existing world system classification?
Although there is a significant overlap between categories in the contingency table, expected and empirical clusters are significantly different
